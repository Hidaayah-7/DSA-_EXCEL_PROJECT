### CATEGORY VIEW INSIGHTS

- Top Revenue Generating Categories

 Smartphones $39M, Smart Televisions $26M and Smart Watches $13M

 These are the categories that dominates revenue, accounting for the bulk of total sales.


- Average Discount % by Category

 Highest 0.9 (Computers & Accessories, Electronics) and Lowest 0.82 (Shower & Wall Mounts)

 High discounts are clustered around tech categories, driving volume sales.


- Product Category with Highest Discount

 Wearable Tech 0.70 and Smartwatches 0.59

 Wearable tech has the highest discount among all, but it doesn’t top revenue or reviews.


### PRODUCT VIEW INSIGHTS

- Top Products by Average Rating (5.0 stars)

 Syncwire LTG to USB Cable, REDTECH USB-C to HDMI Cable, and Amazon Basics USB Extension

 Simple, affordable tech accessories are hitting perfect review scores


- Product with Discount > 50%

 VU 138 cm 4K TV $30K and ECOVACS DEEBOT Vacuum Cleaner $28K

 Premium electronics and appliances are being sold at steep discounts.


- Rating by Price Bucket

 $1,001–$5,000 bucketHighest product count (575)

 Most products fall into this mid-price range.


### METRICS OBSERVATION

Reviews vs. Revenue: Products with the most reviews are not always the top revenue drivers.

Smartwatches have high reviews (76) and discount (0.59) but generate lower revenue ($13M) than Smartphones.


 #### Recommendation:

Amazon should Considers improving the perceived value or functionality of Smartwatches to increase conversion from reviews to revenue.

Analyze if lower ASP (average selling price) is holding back revenue growth.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend that Amazon should:

- Revisit discounting strategy for top performers. Don’t over-discount items that already perform well.

- Consider reducing discount rates for high-performing products with inelastic demand.

- Use top-rated, low-cost products as “customer delight” tools—possibly include them as freebies or loyalty rewards.

- Prioritize Smartphones, Smart TVs, and Smartwatches for ad spend, and target upsell to accessories.

- Highlight 5-star rated products with lower visibility in key homepage placements to boost organic sales.

- Understand customer return rates, repeat purchase behavior, and profit margin by category for deeper insights.
